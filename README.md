npm install -g grunt-cli
npm install
```


## Development

To run the development server:

```

To run the e2e tests and update the screenshots:

## Project layout

Features assets, including tests, html partials and css rules, are grouped
together inside subsection or component folders.

For example `app/userdetails` is a subsection regrouping angular modules,
tests, a css style style sheet and two html partials for the users' profile
page (and the form to update its settings).

`app/components/users` is a components used by many akash modules to request
edit or validate users' info.

## Build

Only relevant for deployement.


### debug target

Built in `debug/`, it works like `app` except for `index.html`
which won't mock api responses.
```
grunt debug
```


### build target

Built in `build/` with the scripts, stylesheet and html partials concatenated
together and without mocked api responses.
```
grunt build
```

The number of requests are therefore limited to few script and stylesheets.


### dist target

Built in `dist/`. Like the build target but assets are also also compressed.
```
grunt dist
```

This process will shorten variables names. As result, you should not
rely on implicite annotation When defining components to inject
implicite annotation let angular injector infer the component to
inject from the argument name but since argument name will change
they will become meaningless.

Instead you should use `$inject` property annotation or inline array
annotation:
```
someModule.factory('greeter', ['$window', function($window) {
  // ...
}]);
